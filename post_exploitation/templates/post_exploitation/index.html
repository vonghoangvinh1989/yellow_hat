        <h1>What is Post-Exploitation?</h1>
        <p>Post-exploitation represents the actions carried out by an attacker after successfully breaching a system's defences. Unlike initial access, which focuses on breaching the perimeter, post-exploitation is about what the attacker does once inside. This can include escalating privileges, stealing data, installing backdoors, or spreading to other systems.</p>
        <p>This is the phase where the depth of an attacker's skills and tools come into play, and the choice of actions largely depends on the attacker's objectives and the opportunities presented by the compromised system.</p>
        <p>Tools such as Empire and Meterpreter –  a payload within the Metasploit framework –  offer extensive capabilities for post-exploitation, including privilege escalation, lateral movement, and persistence.</p>
        <p>Empire, for example, is known for its PowerShell and Python agents that enable a wide range of tactics from executing commands to exfiltrating data, all while maintaining stealth.</p>
        <p>Meterpreter, on the other hand, provides a dynamic, in-memory execution platform that allows attackers to manage the compromised system, pivot to other systems, and access the network's resources without writing to the disk, thereby evading detection.</p>
