        <h1>What is a cybersecurity report?</h1>
        <p>A cybersecurity report presents critical information about cybersecurity threats, risks within a digital ecosystem, gaps in security controls, and how a security program performs. Cybersecurity reports help to foster data-driven communication between boards, executives, security practitioners, and security and risks leaders to ensure that all parties are working together to enhance security programs and mitigate risk.</p>
