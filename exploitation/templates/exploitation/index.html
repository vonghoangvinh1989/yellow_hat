        <h1>Exploitation (Gaining Access)</h1>
        <p>The exploitation phase, often called gaining access, is where ethical hackers actively attempt to breach the target system. Using the vulnerabilities identified during the scanning phase, they launch attacks to infiltrate the network or system.</p>
        <p>In real-world scenarios, exploitation can range from simple password attacks to sophisticated malware deployment, depending on the complexity of the system and the security measures in place. The ethical hackerâ€™s goal here is to prove that the system can be compromised, often by escalating privileges, exfiltrating data, or bypassing security controls.</p>
